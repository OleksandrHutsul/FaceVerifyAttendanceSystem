# FaceVerifyAttendanceSystem

**Relevance of the Topic**: In modern educational institutions, process automation plays a key role in improving the efficiency and quality of educational services. One of the important tasks is the automation of tracking student attendance in classes. Traditional methods of attendance checking, such as manual marking or access card scanning, have several disadvantages, including high labor intensity, the possibility of errors, and fraud. The use of modern technologies, such as facial recognition, database integration, and web interfaces, can significantly improve this process.
  The proposed system, consisting of a website and a WinForms application, provides automated tracking of student attendance by recognizing faces based on photos uploaded by the students. Interaction between the system components is carried out through a database, which allows efficient storage and processing of attendance information. This approach ensures high accuracy, reduces the likelihood of fraud, and significantly simplifies administrative processes for teachers.
  The development and implementation of such systems are relevant for several reasons. First, it aligns with the general trend of digitalization in education. Second, automating routine tasks allows teachers to devote more time directly to the educational process. Third, modern students expect educational institutions to use the latest technologies, which increases the overall level of satisfaction with the learning experience. Therefore, the creation of such systems is an important step towards improving the quality of educational services and optimizing management processes in educational institutions.
